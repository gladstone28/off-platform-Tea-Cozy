Off-Platform Project: Tea Cozy
------------------------------
In this project, we were asked to create a fictional tea shop website on our own computer.


They provided a design spec and image assets to help us along the way. A design spec is an image of a web page outlined with all of its CSS properties and values. 
These are usually created by a designer as a source of instructions for a web developer. 
This project assumes that we would be able to reproduce the basic HTML and CSS with little guidance.

The images and design spec we needed to complete the project are listed below.
